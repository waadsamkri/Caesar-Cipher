# Caesar-Cipher:
This project is about Caesar Cipher technique which is one of the earliest and simplest ciphers. It is simply a type of substitution cipher where each letter of a given text is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet set {A, B, C â€¦ Z}. For example, with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on. Thus, to encrypt a given text, we need an integer value known as key which indicates the number of positions each letter of the text has to be moved down.

The Caesar cypher is one of the most common encryption techniques. The shift cypher is also known as Caesar's cypher, Caesar shift, or Caesar code. Substitution cyphers, such as the Caesar cypher, are a type of substitution cypher.
It may substitute each letter in the plaintext with a different one a set number of places up or down the alphabet using this cypher technique.

How to use:-
1-	Ask the user to input the ciphertext as a string and key.
2-	print output
3-	Ask the user if he/she wants to perform another decryption operation or he/she wants to exit the program
